Project Name: Human Resource Analysis
Tool Used: Power BI

Project Overview:
The primary objective of this project was to provide our Head of Human Resources Management with valuable insights into the company's workforce. Specifically, the aim was to understand key metrics such as the total number of employees, departmental distribution, the count of active employees, and other critical data points.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

1. Total Employee Count
2. Attrition (Number of employees who have left the company)
3. Attrition Rate (Calculated as the ratio of attrition count to total employee count)
4. Active Employees
5. Average Age

To execute this project, I imported the data into Power BI, conducted data transformations to ensure its accuracy, and then proceeded to generate insightful information. One of the noteworthy findings was the breakdown of monthly income by department, revealing that the Research & Development department held the highest share at 63.08%, followed by the Sales department at 32.56%, while the Human Resources department accounted for 4.35%.

Additionally, it's worth mentioning that employees aged 36-45 contributed the most to the monthly income, with a significant share of 34.79%.
